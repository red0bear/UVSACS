## CONFIGURE TOR

 Tor is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node.

Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays ("onion routers"). Users bounce their TCP streams --- web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc. --- around the network, and recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream.
